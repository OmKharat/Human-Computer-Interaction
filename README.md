# Motion-Tracking-and-Mimicking-with-Manipulator-Arm

- The focus of this project is to apply deep learning techniques for tracking the movement of human arm
and hand, and then replicating this motion using a manipulator arm.

- The project uses a Convolutional Neural Netwrok(CNN) to estimate the arm/hand position in real-time,
which is then processed to control the manipulator arm.

- Till date, we have successfully implemented a convolutional neural network for detecting hand pose on
the COCO dataset, achieving promising results in accurately localizing and classifying hand gestures.
